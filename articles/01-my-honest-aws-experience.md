## My Honest AWS Experience

I was first introduced to Clos architecture when I joined AWS as an intern in 2020, and later as a full-time employee in June 2021. 

I was fascinated by the sheer scale AWS operates at. Tens of thousands of servers. Massive automation. Systems that seemed to just work. My early assumption was simple: if AWS is doing it, it must be the right way.

And I wasn’t wrong.

Clos architecture powers not only AWS, but also Azure, Google Cloud, Meta, and most hyperscale environments today. It is the de facto industry standard for building large-scale data center fabrics.

But something interesting happens when you work inside a hyperscaler.

You are surrounded by powerful internal tooling. Automation abstracts away complexity. Infrastructure becomes APIs. Within months, you can deploy, operate, and scale systems without touching the underlying networking fundamentals.

If you're not intentional, you slowly lose touch with the raw mechanics of networking.

This isn’t a flaw of big companies. In fact, it’s the opposite. They build platforms that allow engineers to operate at enormous scale. That abstraction is what enables velocity.

But staying sharp is a personal responsibility.

There are a few ways to reconnect with your networking roots:

- Interview candidates and revisit foundational concepts
- Build and simulate topologies yourself
- Dive deep into device configurations and ask “why” instead of just accepting defaults

The second and third require something uncomfortable: time outside your immediate deliverables. And even if you carve out time, the bigger challenge is structure. What do you study? In what order? How do you go deep instead of skimming?

This repository is my attempt to build that structure.

I don’t know how successful I’ll be. But I’ve learned something important: consistent effort compounds. I once doubted I could complete a master’s degree in telecommunications. I now have that degree—not because I was special, but because I showed up daily and did the work.

Networking is no different.

You train your brain the same way you train your body. Repetition. Discipline. Depth.

This journey starts with understanding why Clos architecture became the backbone of hyperscale data centers.
