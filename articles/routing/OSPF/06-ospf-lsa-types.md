## OSPF LSA Types: What Is Actually in the Database

When two OSPF routers reach Full state, their Link-State Databases are synchronized. But synchronized means nothing without understanding what that database actually contains. The LSDB is not a flat routing table. It is a collection of Link-State Advertisements — each one describing a different piece of the network, originated by a different router, and allowed to travel only so far before it stops.

There are different LSA types, and each one answers a specific question about the topology.

The most fundamental is the **Type 1 Router LSA**. Every OSPF router generates exactly one of these for each area it belongs to. It describes that router's own interfaces — each link, its state, its cost, and what is on the other end. Think of it as a router's self-portrait. Type 1 LSAs are flooded only within the area they originate from. They never cross an area boundary. This is intentional — the raw interface-level topology of one area is nobody else's business.

On broadcast networks, the DR generates a **Type 2 Network LSA** for each multi-access segment it represents. Where a Router LSA describes a router's view of the world, a Network LSA describes the segment's view — specifically, which routers are attached to it and reachable through it. Like Type 1, it stays within the originating area. Together, Type 1 and Type 2 LSAs give every router in an area a complete picture of that area's internal topology — enough to run SPF and build a shortest-path tree.

But what about destinations outside the area? This is where the ABR comes in. When an ABR learns routes from one area, it does not flood those raw Router and Network LSAs into neighboring areas. Instead, it generates **Type 3 Network Summary LSAs** — one per destination prefix — and sends them into each other area it connects to. The receiving routers never see the internal topology of the originating area. They see only the prefix and the cost to reach it through the ABR. This is the summarization that makes areas so effective at containing flooding.

Alongside Type 3, ABRs also generate **Type 4 ASBR Summary LSAs**. When an ASBR exists in the domain, other areas need to know how to reach it — not just the external destinations it advertises, but the ASBR itself. Type 4 solves this by advertising the location of the ASBR throughout the domain, allowing routers in other areas to correctly forward traffic toward external routes.

The external routes themselves arrive via **Type 5 AS External LSAs**, generated by the ASBR. These LSAs advertise destinations that live outside the OSPF autonomous system entirely — routes learned from BGP, static configurations, or redistributed from another protocol. Unlike every other LSA type, Type 5 LSAs flood across the entire OSPF domain, crossing area boundaries freely. Every router in every non-stub area receives them. This is also why stub areas exist — blocking Type 5 LSAs keeps areas with a single exit point from carrying a full map of the external world.

That blocking creates a problem in one specific scenario: what if a stub-like area needs to have its own ASBR? Stub areas cannot contain ASBRs because they block external LSAs entirely. The **Type 7 NSSA External LSA** is the answer. An ASBR inside a Not-So-Stubby Area generates Type 7 LSAs instead of Type 5. These travel only within the NSSA. When they reach the ABR at the area boundary, the ABR translates them into Type 5 LSAs and floods them into the rest of the domain as normal. The NSSA gets to redistribute external routes without receiving the full flood of Type 5 LSAs from the rest of the network.

Each LSA type has a clear origin, a defined scope, and a specific job. Type 1 and 2 build the intra-area picture. Type 3 and 4 bridge areas together. Type 5 and 7 bring the outside world in. Taken together, they are what the LSDB is made of — and what every router uses to build its routing table through SPF.
