## OSPF Areas: Drawing Borders Inside Your Network

Imagine a single OSPF domain with 500 routers, all in one area. Every time a link flaps anywhere in that network, every single router receives a flood of Link-State Advertisements, updates its database, and reruns the SPF algorithm. Here's the thing — the SPF algorithm itself is not the problem. It's the surrounding processes: flooding LSAs across the entire network, maintaining a massive database, processing every update regardless of relevance. A router with no path through a failed link should not be forced to reprocess it anyway.

This is the problem OSPF areas were designed to solve. An area is a logical boundary. Routers inside the same area share a full synchronized Link-State Database. LSAs are flooded only within the area they originate from. Routers outside that area never see the raw topology — they only receive a summary. This keeps flooding local, shrinks each router's LSDB, and limits the blast radius of every topology change.

Every OSPF deployment has one mandatory area: **Area 0**, the backbone. All inter-area traffic must pass through it. Non-backbone areas cannot exchange routing information directly with each other — if Area 1 needs to reach Area 2, that traffic flows through Area 0. The backbone summarizes the topology of each area and distributes it to every other area. It is the spine that holds everything together.

When you introduce multiple areas, not every router plays the same role. A router with all interfaces in one area is an **Internal Router** — it has no visibility beyond its own area. A router that sits at the boundary of two or more areas is an **Area Border Router (ABR)**. It maintains a separate LSDB for each area it belongs to, and when it advertises routes across the border, it strips the raw topology details and replaces them with a clean summary. That summarization is what contains the flooding. Then there is the **Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR)** — this one lives at the edge of the OSPF domain itself, redistributing routes from BGP, static configs, or other routing protocols into OSPF.

OSPF also gives operators control over what LSAs are allowed inside each area. A regular area receives everything — intra-area routes, inter-area summaries, and external routes. A **Stub Area** blocks external LSAs entirely; instead, the ABR injects a default route pointing outward. This dramatically reduces the LSDB for areas that just need a way out, not a full map of the world. A **Totally Stubby Area** goes further and blocks inter-area summaries as well, leaving routers with nothing but a single default route. And then there is the **Not-So-Stubby Area (NSSA)** — a compromise for when a stub-like area still needs to redistribute a few local routes into OSPF. Stub areas normally cannot have an ASBR, but NSSA solves this using a special Type 7 LSA that gets translated to a standard Type 5 by the ABR before leaving the area.

There is one rule Area 0 must always satisfy: it must remain contiguous. Every non-backbone area must connect directly to it. But networks do not always cooperate. If Area 0 becomes partitioned, each side loses visibility into the other and inter-area routing breaks. OSPF handles this with **virtual links** — tunnels built through a non-backbone area that logically reconnect the two fragments of Area 0. A similar case arises when a new area cannot connect directly to Area 0 and can only be reached through another non-backbone area. A virtual link bridges it to the backbone, satisfying the contiguity requirement without any physical changes.

Areas are how OSPF scales. Without them, every router carries the full burden of the entire topology. With them, flooding stays local, databases stay manageable, and topology changes get absorbed at the boundary. In the next section, we will look at the OSPF state machine — the step-by-step process two routers go through before they can exchange a single route.
